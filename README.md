FIS MealPass
============

Generate food coupons <b>#On-The-Go</b> aiming to <b>go green</b> by reducing paper consumption and <b>reduce manual effort</b> every month and ensuring hassle-free dining experience.

The project was inspired by the absence of such applications. It aims to <b>digitalize the way mealpasses are utilized</b> so far.

## Features of Android App

Currently the following functions are implemented:

* Material Design interface
* Seperate Logon options for both Employees and Vendor.
<b>* Features for Employee Login</b>
    * Eligible employees are provided with option to register themselves
    by verifying their E-ID and mobile number registered with FIS.
    * The above will be done using OTP verification.
    * Post OTP verification, employees will be allowed to set their PIN.
    * Employees need to login using their EID and PIN.
    * After logging in, options to generate Meal/Snack pass will be available.
    * The Meal/Snack pass will be generated once in a day and 
    will expire after 60 seconds to avoid reusability.
    * Users are also provided with feedback option about their meal.


Further developments will include:

* Notes sychronization
* Web interface to manage notes ([stub project](https://github.com/federicoiosue/omni-notes-desktop))

You can find a complete changelog inside the application settings menu!

If you need some help on how to use the application you'll find everything you need in the [Help Online](assets/help/help.md) section.

## User guide

Look into the wiki for GIFs-based tutorials: [LINK](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/wiki)

## Build

Watch the following terminal session recording on how to compile distributable files
[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/102898.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/102898)

To be sure that build environment is fully compliant with the project the following command creates a container with all the needed tools to compile the code:

```
cd {project-folder}; rm local.properties; docker rm android-omninotes; docker run -v $PWD:/workspace --name android-omninotes tabrindle/min-alpine-android-sdk:latest bash -c "yes | sdkmanager --update && yes | sdkmanager --licenses && cd /workspace && ./gradlew build --stacktrace -Dorg.gradle.daemon=true -Pandroid.useDeprecatedNdk=true"

```

## Test

To execute all tests included into the project connect a device or emulator, then run the following command:

```shell
./gradlew testAll
```

### Testing Pyramid

To speedup the development more levels of testing are available following the [testing pyramid approach](https://martinfowler.com/articles/practical-test-pyramid.html), each type test requires more time than the previous one.

### Unit Tests
```shell
./gradlew --stacktrace test
```

### Integration Tests
```shell
./gradlew --stacktrace -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.notAnnotation=androidx.test.filters.LargeTest connectedAndroidTest
```

### UI Tests
```shell
./gradlew --stacktrace -Pandroid.testInstrumentationRunnerArguments.annotation=androidx.test.filters.LargeTest connectedPlayDebugAndroidTest
```
Notice that in this case I specified a single flavor to run tests on. This could be a useful and faster approach when you're testing specific flavor features.  

## Contributing

Due to the fact that I'm using [gitflow](https://github.com/nvie/gitflow) as code versioning methodology, you as developer should **always** start working on [develop branch](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/tree/develop) that contains the most recent changes.

There are many features/improvements that are not on **my** roadmap but someone else could decide to work on them anyway: hunt for issues tagged as [Help Wanted](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/issues?utf8=âœ“&q=label%3A"Help+wanted") to find them!

Feel free to add yourself to [contributors.md](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/blob/develop/contributors.md) file.

### New feature or improvements contributions

This kind of contributions **must** have screenshots or screencast as demonstration of the new additions.

### Code style

If you plan to manipulate the code then you'll have to do it by following a [specific code style](https://gist.github.com/federicoiosue/dee53e882b3c70d544f8608769eb02fc).
Also pay attention if you're using any plugin that automatically formats/cleans/rearrange your code and set it to only change that code that you touched and not the whole files.

### Test your code contributions!

All code changes and additions **must** be tested.
See the [related section](#test) for more informations or this two pull requests comments: [one](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/pull/646#pullrequestreview-187973443) and [two](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/pull/683#issuecomment-506206689)

### Forking project

When forking the project you'll have to modify some files that are strictly dependent from my own development / build / third-party-services environment. Files that need some attention are the following:

  - *gradle.properties*: this is overridden by another file with the same name inside the *omniNotes* module. You can do the same or leave as it is, any missing property will let the app gracefully fallback on a default behavior.
  - *.travis.yml*: if you use [TravisCI](https://travis-ci.org/) as continuous integration platform and a SonarQUBE instance for code quality analysis you'll have to modify this file according to your needs.

## Code quality

A public instance of SonarQube is available both to encourage other developers to improve their code contributions (and existing code obviously) and to move the project even further into transparency and openness.

Checkout for it [here](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=omni-notes)

Pull requests will be automatically analyzed and rejected if they'll rise the code technical debt.

## Dependencies

They're all listed into the [build.gradle](https://github.com/federicoiosue/Omni-Notes/blob/develop/omniNotes/build.gradle) file but due to the fact that many of the dependences have been customized by me I'd like to say thanks here to the original developers of these great libraries:
